================================================================================

> Analog/linear.
	- Produce, amplify or respond to V.
	- Analog ICs include many
	  amplifiers, timers, oscillators, voltage regulators.
> Digital/logic.
	- Respond/produce signals
	  having only two voltage levels.
	- Digital ICs include
	  microprocessors, memories, microcomputers,
	  MANY kinds of simpler chips.
> Some ICs combine analog and digital functions
  on a single chip.
> IC chips are supplied in many different packages.
	- Dual in-line package. DIP.
	  Most common kind of IC.
	- CP1234. Date code.
	  12 = 2012.
	  34 = 34th week.
	- Deprecated package TO-5.
	  Looks like diode with many leads.
	  Usually in metal can.



	[ Digital integrated circuits ]

> ALL digital integrated circuits
  are made from gates.
> Gates are like electronically controlled switches.
> Gates with more than two inputs
  are called logic circuits.
  They make logical decisions.
> Single input gate can be NOT gate or inverter.
> Single input gate can be buffer.
  It isolates gates from other circuits.
  Or allows them to drive higher loads.
> 3-state inverters and buffers
  have output that can be electrically disconnected
  from the remainder of circuit.
  The output is then neither high, nor low.
  it F L O A T S and appears as very high resistance.



	[ Data highways ]

> Gates exchange information by bits.
> Bits encoded as highs and lows. 1s/0s.
> Bits are sent over wires.
  Those wires are called buses.
	- Buses can be serial or parallel.



	[ How gates are used ]

> Network of gates are called logic circuit.
	- Combinational.
	- Sequential.



	[ Flip-flops ]

> More like a symbol
  of the underlying construction
  of logic gates,
  made from transistors.
