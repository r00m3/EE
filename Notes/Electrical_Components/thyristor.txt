	Thyristor

================================================================================

> Thyristor is semiconductor device.
> With 3 leads.
> Small current at one lead will allow
  a much larger current to flow
  through the other two leads.
> Controlled current is either ON or OFF.
> Thyristors do not amplify fluctuating
  signals like transistors do.
> They are rather SOLID-STATE SWITCHES.



	[ Silicon-controlled rectifiers. SCRs. ]

> Sometimes called 4-layer PNPN diode.
> Passes a current in only one direction.
> Can be used as "latch" switch.
  A latching switch is a switch that maintains its state
  after being activated.
  A push-to-make, push-to-break switch
  would therefore be a latching switch â€“
  each time you actuate it, whichever state the switch is left in
  will persist until the switch is actuated again.

	[ SCRs are categorized according to current they can switch. ]

> Low current.
	- Switch up to 1A.
	- At up to 100V.
> Medium current.
	- Switch up to 10A.
	- At up to several hundred V.
	- Used in solid-state switching for auto engines.
> High current.
	- Switch up to 2.500A.
	- At up to several thousand V.
	- Used in motors, lights, appliances.



	[ TRIACs. ]

> TRIACs are essentially SCRs that can handle AC currents.
> Equivalent to two SCRs connected in parallel.
> TRIAC has 5 layers + N-Type region.
> All 3 leads make contact with TWO layers.

	[ Usage of TRIACs. ]

> Like SCRs, categorized according to current
  they can switch.
> TRIACs dont have high power capacity
  of high current SCRs.

	> Low current.
		- Switch up to 1A.
		- At up to several hundred V.
	> Medium current.
		- Switch up to 40A.
		- At up to 1_000V.



	[ Two-lead thyristors ]

> SCR or TRIAC will switch on WITHOUT a GATE
  signal if the V across its other two leads
  reaches a certain level(breakdown voltage).
> This self-switching ability makes possible
  two-lead thyristors.

	> Four-layer diode.
		- SCR without a gate.
		- Switches(on/off) DC voltage.
	> DIAC.
		- 3-Layer device.
		- Similar to PNP junction transistor without
		  a base lead.
		- Switches(on/off) AC voltage.
