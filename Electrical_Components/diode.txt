________________________________________________________________________________

			Current flows through the diode in only one direction.
			A diode will NOT conduct until the forward reaches
			a certain threshold point.
			For silicon diodes this voltage is about 0.6 volt.


________ Types of diodes _______________________________________________________

> Small signal.
	- Used to transform low current AC to DC.
	- Detect(demodulate) radio signals.
	- Multiply voltage.
	- Perform logic.
	- Absorb voltage spikes.

> Power rectifier.
	- Functionally identical to small signal diodes.
	- Power rectifiers can handle much more current.
	- They are installed in large metal packages,
	  that soak up excess heat and transfer it
	  to a metal heat sink.
	- Used mainly in power supplies.

> Zener.
	- Designed to have a specific reverse breakdown
	  (conduction) voltage.
	- This let them function like a
	  voltage sensitive switch.
	- Zener diodes having breakdown voltages [ Vz ]
	  2-200 volts are available.

> Light-emitting.
	- ALL diodes emit some electromagnetic radiation.
	- Some of them emit considerably more radiation
	  than silicon diodes.
	- Theyre called light-emitting diodes.

> Photodiode.
	- ALL diodes respond to some degree
	  when illuminated by light.
	- Diodes designed specifically to detect light
	  are called photodiodes.
	- They include a glass or plastic window
	  through which the light enters.
	- Often they have a large, exposed
	  junction region.
	- Silicon makes good photodiodes.
