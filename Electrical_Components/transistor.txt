________________________________________________________________________________

	A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor
that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers.
In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a field-effect transistor (FET),
uses only one kind of charge carrier.
A bipolar transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals
to control a much larger current flowing between the terminals,
making the device capable of amplification or switching.

	- Wikipedia.

			Transistors are semiconductor devices with 3 leads.
			A very small current or voltage at one lead
			can control a much larger current flowing through
			the other two leads.

	- Very thin.
	- Has fewer doping atoms than the emitter and collector.
	- Resistors before BJT base should be considered.
	- Base-emitter junction(or diode)
	  will not conduct until the forward voltage
	  excess 0.6V.

________ Usage of bipolar transistors __________________________________________

> Small signal and switching.
	- Used to amplify low level signals.
	- Designed to be fully operated ON/OFF.
	- Some transistors can both amplify
	  and switch well.
> Power.
	- Used in high power amplifiers, power supplies.
	- Large size and exposed metal keep them cool.

> High-frequency.
	- Operate at radio, television, microwave frequencies.
	- Base region is very thin and actual chip is very small.


________ Field-effect transistors. FETs ________________________________________

> Became more important than bipolar transistors.
> Easy to make and require less silicone.
> Output current controlled by a small input voltage
  and practically NO input current.
> Two major FET families :
	- Junction.
	- Metal-oxide-semiconductor.


________ Junction FETs. JFETs __________________________________________________

> Drain. (Collector).
> Gate. (Base).
	- Increases channel resistance
	  limiting drain-source current.
	- Can be used as amplifier or switch.
	- Gate resistance is very high.
	  Therefore the JFET has no effect
	  on external components
	  connected to its gate.
	  This is because gate and channel
	  forms a diode.
> Source. (Emitter).


________ Usage of JFETs ________________________________________________________

					Cant be used for high power roles.
					Most are installed in small plastic
					or metal packages.

> Small signal and switching.
	- Small signal JFETs are used at the input stage
	  of amplifiers to provide a high resistance input.
	- They are used also as switches.

> High frequency.
	- High frequency JFETs are used to
	  amplify or produce high frequency
	  signals.


________ Metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs. MOSFETs _______________________________

					Become most important transistor.
					Used in microcomputers and
					memory integrated circuits.

> Easy to make.
> Can be very small.
> Consume negligible power.
> Gate has no contact with source and drain.
> Input resistance of MOSFET is the highest
  of any transistor.
> Almost infinite gate resistance.
> Gate pulls no current from
  external circuits.
> MOSFETs can function as voltage-controlled
  variable resistors.
> MOSFETs can switch very HIGH currents
  in a few billionths of a second.


________ Usage of MOSFETs ______________________________________________________

> Like FETs, MOSFETs installed in small metal
  or plastic packages.
> Used to give amplifiers an ultra-high input resistance.
> Also used as voltage controlled resistors/switches.
> Power MOSFETs allow a few volts to switch or
  amplify many amperes at very fast speeds.


________ Unijunction transistors. UJTs _________________________________________

> UJT is not a true transistor.
> More like a diode with two cathode connections.
> Works like a voltage-controlled switch.
> Does not amplify.

	- Normally a small current will flow
	  from base1 to base2.
	- When voltage applied to emitter reaches
	  certain threshold (several volts),
	  the UJT switches ON,
	  high current flows from base1
	  to the EMITTER.
