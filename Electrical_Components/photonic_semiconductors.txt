> Light is composed of particles called photons.
> Photons behave like waves of energy.
> Photons are not necessarily visible.
> Only those you can see are collectively called light.
> Photons are produced when an electron thats been
  excited to a higher than normal energy level
  falls back to its normal level.

> Visible light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
> Ultraviolet, visible, infrared radiation
  are together called the optical spectrum.
> Many photonic semiconductors emit or detect near-infrared
  radiation.
> Many photonic components can operate in both
  visible and near-infrared.
> Its common to refer to near-infrared as light.


________ Optical components ____________________________________________________

				Optical components conduct, bend or change
				the characteristics of light.

> Filters transmit only a narrow
  band of optical wavelengths.
> Reflectors reflect some or most
  of an outcoming light beam.
> Beamsplitters reflect part of an
  oncoming light beam and
  transmit the remainder.
> Lenses bend light.
	- Convex lens.
	- Concave lens.


________ Semiconductor light detectors _________________________________________

> Small area photodiodes.
	- Very fast response time.
	- Low sensitivity.
> Large area photodiodes.
	- Very high sensitivity.
	- Low response time.
> Photoresistors.
> Phototransistors.
	- ALL transistors are light sensitive.
	  Phototransistors are more sensitive.
	- Light sensitive FETs are available.
	- Most common phototransistor is NPN
	  junction transistor with a large,
	  exposed base region.
	  Photons entering the base replace the
	  base-emitter current of ordinary NPN transistor.
	- Photoresistor directly amplifies variations
	  in the number of photons.
> Photothyristors.
	- Photothyristors are various kinds
	  of light-activated thyristors.
	- You can think of them as
	  light-activated switches.
	- Light-activated silicon controlled rectifier. LASCR.
	  Is the most important photothyristor.
	- Light activated TRIACs are also made.
	- Neither can switch as much current
	  as conventional thyristors.
> Solar cells.
	- PN junction photodiodes.
	- Exceptionally large light sensitive area.
	- Single silicon solar cell
	  generates 0.5V in bright sunlight.
